# TOOLKITtoATOM
XSLT and related files for bulk XML migration from Archivists' Toolkit to AtoM

These files were used for a successful project to migrate EAD finding aids from Archivists' Toolkit (version 2, update 15) into Atom version 2.1.1.

The data cleaning and migration project was completed in January 2015. The code is provided "as is" in case it helps other users working on bulk XML migration projects.
