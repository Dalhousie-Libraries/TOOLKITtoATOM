# TOOLKITtoATOM
XSLT and related files for bulk XML migration from Archivists' Toolkit to AtoM

These files were used for a successful project to migrate EAD finding aids from Archivists' Toolkit (version 2, update 15) into AtoM version 2.1.1.

The project was completed in January 2015. The code is provided "as is" in case it helps other users working on bulk XML migration projects.

See https://www.accesstomemory.org for more information about AtoM.

See http://www.archiviststoolkit.org/ for more information about Archivists' Toolkit.

See http://findingaids.library.dal.ca/ for the finding aids catalogue that was built using these data migration files.
